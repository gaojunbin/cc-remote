# deploy/

Reference files for the production deploy (public VPS relay + wrapper on your
machine). The **full step-by-step guide is in the main [README](../README.md#生产部署公网-vps-中继--你机器上的-wrapper)**
([English](../README_en.md#production-deploy-public-vps-relay--wrapper-on-your-machine)).

- `install.sh` — versioned GitHub Release bootstrap. It requires an explicit
  `relay` or `wrapper` role, detects OS/CPU, downloads that one role archive,
  verifies its `SHA256SUMS` entry before extraction, rejects unsafe archive
  paths, and then invokes the in-bundle installer. It never pipes a network
  response into a shell.
- `build_release.py` / `release_manifest.py` — reproducible role-bundle builder
  and fail-closed manifest validator. Relay artifacts contain `web/dist` and
  `requirements-relay.lock`; Wrapper artifacts contain no Web tree and use
  `requirements-wrapper.lock`. Each artifact carries the product version,
  protocol, full Git SHA, OS, architecture, and Python runtime contract.
- `install-relay.sh` — first-install/upgrade entry for a published Relay
  bundle. It creates secrets only when `/opt/cc-remote/.env` does not exist,
  then delegates to the existing transactional VPS installer. The explicit
  `--allow-private-origins` first-install option binds IPv4 `0.0.0.0:8765`
  for simultaneous LAN/Tailscale access and requires firewall restriction;
  the default remains loopback-only behind Caddy.
- `install-wrapper.sh` — first-install/upgrade entry for published macOS and
  Linux Wrapper bundles. It builds the immutable release before pairing and
  activation, stores device authority outside the release, atomically switches
  `current`, installs a per-user LaunchAgent or root-managed systemd unit, and
  restores the previous release/service definition on failure. The installer
  requires and explicitly selects the service user's daily
  `~/.local/bin/claude`; it never silently falls back to the SDK-bundled CLI.
- `setup-vps.sh` — atomic VPS release installer. It validates a user-owned
  upload, copies it to a new root-owned
  `/opt/cc-remote/releases/release-*` directory, builds that release's own
  venv, validates the Python/web protocol pair, then switches the
  `/opt/cc-remote/current` symlink in one rename. The running tree is never
  overlaid with `rsync --delete`. If relay restart/readiness fails, `current`,
  Caddyfile, and the relay unit roll back together and the previous release is
  health-checked. The previous full code + web + venv directory is retained.
  Run `sudo bash ~/cc-remote-upload/deploy/setup-vps.sh your-domain.com \
  ~/cc-remote-upload`; the optional second argument defaults to the repository
  containing the invoked script. Shared secrets stay only in
  `/opt/cc-remote/.env`, whose `WEB_STATIC_DIR` must point to
  `/opt/cc-remote/current/web/dist`.
- `Caddyfile` — reverse proxy + auto Let's Encrypt TLS (`wss://domain/ws` →
  `127.0.0.1:8765`) plus an early 4 KiB login-body limit. Replace
  `cc-remote.example.com` with your domain.
- `Caddyfile.insecure` — explicit plain-HTTP public-IP template selected only
  when `ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1`, the setup target is a public IPv4 address, and
  `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` exactly matches `http://that-address`. It omits HSTS and
  permits `ws://` in CSP; login credentials, cookies, wrapper tokens, and all
  session traffic are unencrypted in this mode. Pass the IP and source
  directory to the same immutable `setup-vps.sh` flow used for TLS.
- `cc-remote-relay.service` — systemd unit for the relay on the VPS.
- `cc-remote-wrapper.service` — systemd unit for the wrapper on your machine
  (edit `User` + paths first). It reads root-only
  `/etc/cc-remote/wrapper.env`, hides that file and any legacy repository
  `.env` from model descendants, and disables core dumps.
- `env.relay.example` / `env.wrapper.example` — environment templates for each
  side. Install the wrapper template as root:root mode 0600 at the path above.
- `com.muggle.cc-remote.wrapper.plist.in` — secret-free macOS LaunchAgent
  template. The runtime reads the current user's mode-0600 device JSON instead
  of embedding control credentials in the plist.
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` / `env.relay.docker.example` — the same
  relay release as a container (build `web/dist` in a Node stage, install the
  hash-locked wheels, run as the `ccremote` user). See the container section
  below; this is an alternative to the systemd + Caddy path, not a fork of it.
- `nginx-reverse-proxy.conf.example` — a WebSocket reverse-proxy front for
  hosts that already run nginx instead of the managed Caddy. Loopback-only
  requirement is documented in the file header.
- `work_registry_snapshot.py` — snapshots provider-local Work SQLite databases
  through SQLite's backup API, restores the matching pre-release images before
  an older wrapper is restarted, and verifies the v34 Codex ownership backfill.

Protocol v35 is a coordinated upgrade: publish freshly built Relay/Web and
Wrapper artifacts from the same tagged commit. The strict protocol gate is
intentional and mixed protocol versions will not communicate. `setup-vps.sh`
rejects a missing or mismatched web build manifest. Stop the wrapper first;
activate the v35 relay/web release; then start the v35 wrapper.

The wrapper installer treats local Work data as part of the release
transaction. It stops the existing service, writes a private snapshot below
the install root's `rollback-data/`, starts the new release, and refuses the
activation unless the Codex Work schema and all legacy ownership rows are
ready. On failure it stops the new process, restores both SQLite images, then
restores and starts the previous code. If data restoration fails, it leaves the
wrapper stopped instead of running old code against a new schema. A manual or
legacy-layout deployment must use the same order: stop the wrapper, run
`work_registry_snapshot.py snapshot` from the new staging tree, activate and
verify v35, and retain that snapshot with the previous release. To roll back,
stop v35, run `work_registry_snapshot.py restore`, then switch and start the old
release. Never copy only `registry.sqlite3` while the wrapper is live because
committed state may still be in its WAL file. Restoring a pre-release snapshot
also restores pre-release Work metadata: sessions, projects, or schedule state
created after activation will no longer be registered (their private files are
not deleted). Use this for immediate failed activation; after normal use,
prefer a roll-forward fix unless that metadata rollback is explicitly accepted.

## Container deploy (Docker) and the nginx alternative

The official relay install is a systemd venv staged by `setup-vps.sh` behind a
managed Caddy. Two alternative topologies are supported for hosts that already
manage their own services or TLS:

**Docker container.** `Dockerfile` builds the same relay release as a
multi-stage image: the Node stage compiles `web/dist` from source, the Python
stage installs the same hash-locked wheels `setup-vps.sh` pins and runs
`python -m cc_remote.relay` as a non-root `ccremote` user. From the `deploy/`
directory:

```bash
cp env.relay.docker.example env.relay   # then fill in the secrets
chmod 600 env.relay
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz       # -> {"ok":true,...}
```

Fill in `LOGIN_PASSWORD` (at least 16 characters), `SESSION_SECRET`, and
`WRAPPER_TOKEN`. Generate each secret separately with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
The wrapper uses the same wrapper token. APNs and Web Push settings are optional.
No public domain or certificate belongs in this configuration.

The compose file uses bridge networking and a `8765:8765` port mapping. The left
side is the host port; for example, `18765:8765` publishes the container's port
8765 on host port 18765. A named volume preserves device/Web Push/APNs state.

In Nginx Proxy Manager, add a Proxy Host with these settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Domain Names | Your public domain, configured only in NPM |
| Scheme | `http` |
| Forward Hostname / IP | The Docker host address reachable from NPM |
| Forward Port | The left-hand port in the compose mapping |
| Websockets Support | Enabled |
| SSL | Select/request a certificate and enable Force SSL |

When NPM runs in another container, `127.0.0.1` points to NPM itself; use the
Docker host's reachable address instead. Limit access to the published upstream
port to the proxy, using an appropriate bind address and host/network rules.
Open the HTTPS domain to log in. Direct HTTP remains useful for `/healthz`,
but browser login in this deployment requires HTTPS.

The image defaults to `PUBLIC_ORIGIN=auto`: the proxy must preserve the original
Host header, as NPM does by default. The relay requires an exact
`Origin=https://<Host>` match for browser writes/WebSockets and always sets
Secure cookies, even though the upstream connection is HTTP. Each login is
bound to its own origin, which also supplies its APNs navigation links. No
domain is learned globally, and forwarded host/protocol headers cannot relax
these checks. Forwarded client IPs from Docker bridge peers are not trusted;
such clients share the proxy peer's login rate limit.

For an existing `env.relay`, remove the old domain-specific `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`
assignment (or set it to `auto`) and any loopback-only `RELAY_HOST` override.
Leave `ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` and `ALLOW_PRIVATE_ORIGINS` disabled in auto mode.
Rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build` after updating the checkout.

**nginx instead of Caddy.** `nginx-reverse-proxy.conf.example` terminates TLS
and proxies the `/ws` WebSocket to `127.0.0.1:8765`. This example uses a
host-installed proxy. An explicitly pinned `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` still requires the
trusted effective request scheme to match, so retain loopback proxy transport
for that topology; use auto mode for the Docker/NPM bridge topology above.

**Mainland-China mirrors.** The Docker build defaults to PyPI.org. Behind the
GFW, build with Aliyun as the primary index and TUNA as the fallback (both
carry the sdist-only `http-ece` wheel):

```bash
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg PIP_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple \
  --build-arg PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple \
  -t cc-remote-relay .
```

## Native terminal coordination

- **Claude Code:** run `claude` directly for the untouched official process;
  Remote treats direct CLI, Desktop, and Agent View ownership as read-only.
  Explicit takeover may gracefully terminate the exact same-user Claude process
  with SIGTERM and then resume through the SDK, but it never kills the terminal
  shell, escalates to SIGKILL, or silently adopts a process.
- **Codex Code:** `CC_REMOTE_CODEX_DAEMON=auto` prefers Codex's official shared
  app-server daemon. Set it to `off` only to force the legacy private stdio path.
  Optional multi-account installs provide either inline
  `CC_REMOTE_CODEX_PROFILES_JSON` or a private
  `CC_REMOTE_CODEX_PROFILES_FILE`; the macOS LaunchAgent defaults the latter to
  `~/.cc-remote/codex-profiles.json`. Each unique `CODEX_HOME` owns a daemon.
  When a sibling home has no duplicate standalone payload, first bootstrap
  safely reuses the verified primary managed CLI through a profile-local
  `current` link; account data and daemon sockets remain isolated.
  Leaving both empty preserves the exact single-account path and UI.
- **Work:** both engines stay on private per-process control planes regardless
  of the Code settings. Codex Work sessions and schedules may select any
  configured profile; the local registry freezes that ownership across retries
  and default-profile changes.

## Security (short version)

The relay is exposed publicly; `LOGIN_PASSWORD` or `LOGIN_USERS_JSON`,
`SESSION_SECRET`, and `WRAPPER_TOKEN` or `WRAPPER_TOKENS_JSON` are the
authentication secrets. Claude defaults to
`bypassPermissions`; Codex inherits its local sandbox and defaults to approval
policy `never`. Treat every logged-in client as holding remote agent/shell
authority on the wrapper machine. Use strong secrets, keep relay `.env` out of
git, never store the production wrapper token in a model-readable repository
file. Always prefer TLS at Caddy; the public-IP escape hatch sends the login
password, browser cookie, wrapper token, and session traffic unencrypted.
See the [security section](../README.md#安全须知务必读) of the main README.

The relay itself limits unfinished login bodies to 32 concurrent reads and 10
seconds each. The managed Caddy global block additionally sets 10-second header,
15-second body, 30-second write, 2-minute idle, and 64 KiB header limits before
requests reach the relay. Other global options and sites are preserved. If a
shared Caddyfile already contains an unmanaged `servers` block, setup fails
closed and asks the administrator to reconcile it instead of silently creating
ambiguous global behavior.
